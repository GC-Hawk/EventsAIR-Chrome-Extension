# EventsAir Data Clearer

## Overview

The EventsAir Data Clearer is a Chrome extension designed to enhance the user experience on the EventsAIR platform. It helps users clear locally stored data such as cache and IndexedDB, and performs a hard reload of the page to ensure smooth operation. This tool is particularly useful for non-technical users who may find it challenging to clear browser data manually.

Developed by [Håkon Jevnesveen](https://jevnesveen.no/en/cv/), this extension aims to reduce the workload on IT teams by empowering users to resolve common issues themselves.
